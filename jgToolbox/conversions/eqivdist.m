function [newdist] = eqivdist(oldCPI,newCPI,origdist,size)% function [newdist] = eqivdist(oldCPI,newCPI,origdist,size)%% Computes the distance necessary to equate the desired% cycles per image [newCPI] with the old cycles per image% [oldCPI] in terms of cycles per degree of visual angle,as% determined by [origdist] (the original distance), and [size]% (the distal image size). Returns in the units of [origdist]% and [size]. Units of [origdist] and [size] are assumed to% be the same.%% March 24, 1997.
