function [cm,points] = pix2cm(pix,screenSize,resolution)% function [cm] = pix2cm(pix,screenSize,resolution)%% Converts [PIX] to centimeters. Takes the optional arguments% [screenSize] and [resolution]. Both are 2 element vectors.% [screenSize] is the width and height of the screen in cm. [resolution]% is the width and height of the screen in pixels. If there is a% discrepancy between the two, the higher resolution is taken. The% computation works if only the width or the height is given in both.% The default assumes a resolution of 72 pixels/inch.% 1 cm = 28.3464566929 points.% Both the size in [cm] and the number of points/cm are returned.%% June 26, 1998  JMG  U of T Vision Labif nargin == 3	points = max(resolution./screenSize);else	points = 72/inch2cm(1); endcm = pix/points;return;
