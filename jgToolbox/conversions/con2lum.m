function [OutMatrix] = Con2Lum(InMatrix,Lave)% function [OutMatrix] = Con2Lum(InMatrix,Lave)%% This function converts an input matrix INMATRIX into luminance values % (from contrast) and returns it in OUTMATRIX. Contrast is defined here as% (L(pixel)-Laverage)/Laverage. The user must supply average luminance (Lave).%% June 22, 1996		J Gold	P J Bennett A B Sekuler 	University of Toronto Vision Lab   OutMatrix = InMatrix.*Lave;					% Multiply all elements by Lave.OutMatrix = OutMatrix + Lave;				% Add Lave from all elements.return
