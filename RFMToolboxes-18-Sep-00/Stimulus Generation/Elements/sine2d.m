% SINE2D  Create a 2D sinewave grating.%% sinemat = sine2d( dim, lambda, theta, phi, mean, contrast )%     dim - size [ M ; N ] of matrix;  square if N omitted%     lambda   - wavelength in pixels%     theta    - angle of wave vector in radians (def=0)%     mean     - mean value of grating (def=0)%     contrast - contrast of grating (def=1)%	  phi - phase of the grating in radians (def =0)%% When <mean>~=0, <contrast> is interpreted as contrast;  when <mean>=0,% <contrast> is interpreted as amplitude.
