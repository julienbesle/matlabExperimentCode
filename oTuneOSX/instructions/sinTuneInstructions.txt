***On each trial you will see two patterns that are flashed on the screen. Onewill contain thick horizontal bars embedded in visual noise, and the other will containonly that visual noise.  The visual noise will often appear as a wavy checkerboard.However, the visual noise will vary from trial to trial.  ***Your task is to determine whether the thick horizontal bars appear in the first of the two patterns presented, or the second.***If the thick horizontal bars appear in the first of the two patterns presented, press the key labelled "1" and if it appears in the second of the two patterns presented, press the key labelled "2".  If you are correct, you will hear no auditory feedback.  Only if you are incorrect, you will hear a low tone. ***This experiment is self-paced.  When you are ready to intiate a trial, press the spacebar.A fixation point will appear, and the two patterns will follow.  Then you will be required to make your decision (key "1" or key "2").  Once you make your decision, the next trial will be initiated when you press the spacebar.  You will know you are finished when the screen goes all blue.  This is your cue to come out and tell Donna that you are done.  ***The experiment should take between 15 and 30 minutes; because it is self-paced, the time will vary from person to person.***Press a button to continue.***
