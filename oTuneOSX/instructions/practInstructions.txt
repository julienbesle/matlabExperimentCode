Please move your eyes around the screen and look at each pattern directly. Pick the pattern at the bottom of the screen that matches the pattern at the top. If the matched pattern  appears on the left, press the key marked with the label "1" and if it  appears on the right, press the button marked  with the label "2". If you select the incorrect pattern you will hear a low tone. If you are correct you will hear a high pitchedtone.***Press a button to continue.******
